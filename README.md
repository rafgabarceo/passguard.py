# passguard.py
simple password manager

This is a Python-based password manager. This is for educational purposes only, and serves as partial-fulfilment of a requirement of LBYCPA1

## How does it work?
Passguard uses Python's built SQLite3 module for its database. SQLite3 is a lightweight, easy to use version of SQL. In order to encrypt the data, Passguard uses the SQLCipher that can be imported. The modules required to run will be stated below.

## Required modules
Passguard requires a few modules that can be installed through Python's package manager, pip.

*Tabulate - helps with the formatting of the database `pip install tabulate`
*Pyperclip - main module that deals with copy and pasting `pip install pyperclip`
